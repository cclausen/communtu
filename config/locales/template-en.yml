Next you choose the menu-entry "Origin" in the lower-left corner. In the list, which now appears above this section of Synaptic, you choose the entry "packages.communtu.de". In the main-part of Synaptic, on the right side of the program-window, you now have a list of the installed metapackages. To remove a metapackage you right-click it and choose "Mark for Removal". To finish the removal of a metapackage you now have just to click on "Apply" in the menu-bar above. However, the packages contained in this metapackage will not be removed! To remove these you have to choose the packages with Synaptic and remove them individually.
