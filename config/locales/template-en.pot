In the main-part of Synaptic, on the right side of the program-window, you now have a list of the installed metapackages. To remove a metapackage you right-click it and choose \"Mark for Removal\". To finish the removal of a metapackage you now have just to click on \"Apply\" in the menu-bar above. However, the packages contained in this metapackage will not be removed!
