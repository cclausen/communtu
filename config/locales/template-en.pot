The last two steps are about the license and the security of the progams (which sources you want to be added and if the programs shall be open or closed source). You can now click on \"Save rough selection and install\" to get to the end and install the preselected bundles or you can click on \"Save rough selection\" to make a more detailed choice of the bundles being installed. Finally you need to add the Communtu sources to your system and, when this is finished, you only have to click on \"Install\" and the chosen bundles will be installed.<p> The second way is to click on <b>Bundle</b> and then on \"Published bundles\". You now see a list with every bundle created in Communtu. Here you can install a bundle directly with a click on \"Install through metapackage\", assuming you have added the sources earlier.
